Buddhist Study Association (BSA) is a student organization at Indiana Univerisity Bloomington. Students interested in Buddhism——Whether it's Theravada or Mahayana, are welcome to join. Usually, we have a meditation period in the late afternook every weekday (Monday through Friday) at our office within IMU. Due to coronavirous, we made it virtual. From 6:30-7:00 p.m., you can join us on Zoom at this link: [https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025).

BSA was established more than a decade ago. Our current leader is Doju, a second-year Master's student at IU studying religion. He has been ordained as a monk according to the Japanese tradition. Our previous leader is Hanwen Fan, who served BSA for two years. He is now a Master's student at Northeastern University. All of the pictures shown on this site were taken by him. Yifeng, a staff member at the School of Publich Health, has been a regular helper for BSA. 

If you want to join our regulare newsletter, please send your request to Doju at djlayton@indiana.edu.

This is what our office looks like:
