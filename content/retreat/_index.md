We invided Master Jiru (释继如) from [Mid-America Buddhist Association](http://www.maba-usa.org/) (MABA) to lead a one-day retreat. The retreat was held at a classroom on the third floor of School of Education. Around 20 people attended the retreat. 

The next day, Master Jiru visited [Sanshin Zen Community](http://www.sanshinji.org/) in Bloomington. 

The following photos were taken by Hanwen in both days.
