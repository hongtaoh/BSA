Buddhist Study Association (BSA) is a student organization at Indiana Univerisity Bloomington. Students interested in Buddhism——Whether it's Theravada or Mahayana, are welcome to join. Usually, we have a meditation period in the late afternook every weekday (Monday through Friday) at our office on the third floor of Indiana Momorial Union (IMU). Due to the coronavirous, we made this activity virtual. From 6:30-7:00 p.m., you can join us on Zoom at this link: [https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025).

BSA was established more than a decade ago. Our current leader is Doju, a second-year Master's student at IU studying religion. He has been ordained as a monk according to the Japanese tradition. Our previous leader is Hanwen Fan, who served BSA for two years. He is now a Master's student at Northeastern University. All of the pictures shown on this site were taken by Hanwen. Yifeng, a staff member at the School of Publich Health, has been a regular help for BSA throughout the years. 

If you want to join our regulare newsletter, please send your request to Doju at djlayton@indiana.edu.

This is what our office looks like:
