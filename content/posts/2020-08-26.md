Hi everyone,

For those of you who showed up to meditation on Monday, I mentioned that we had a different link for meditation on Wednesday. We have simplified and we are now using the same link for the 6:30-7:00 pm meditation every weekday. The link is the same as the one that I sent in the previous e-mail, but it now works for Wednesday evenings too ([https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025)).

There is also a book discussion group with people from the Sanshin Zen Community in town that follows the Wednesday evening Zoom meditation (but you certainly don't need to stay for it if you just want to come to meditation). Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is the current book being discussed. You do not have to read anything advance if you'd like to participate in the book discussion. 

Please feel free to join us for meditation any evening of the week (except weekends), and if you're interested in joining but don't have any experience doing meditation yet, just respond to this e-mail and we can arrange a time to do a quick introduction for you.

Also, as a reminder, the BSA will have a virtual table at the online involvement fair tomorrow from 4 to 7 pm. If you want to find out more about the BSA, please drop in anytime during that window. The link for that is [https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119](https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119).

Many bows,

Doju
