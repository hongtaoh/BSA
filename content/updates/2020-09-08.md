Hi everyone,

I hope you're settling into your class schedules by now and managing to stay healthy.

This Friday (the 11th), we will hold our regular 6:30-7:00 p.m. meditation period outside and in person. We will meet at the IU Tailgate Field at the corner of N Fess Ave. and E 14th St. If you put "IU Tailgate Field" into Google Maps you should be able to find directions to it; it is just south of the football stadium. The meditation period will be held concurrently on Zoom at the usual link ([https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025)) for those who are not in Bloomington or are not able to attend in person. I will try to bring some cushions to sit on, but if you have your own please bring it.

Afterwards, we will share a vegetarian Chinese meal from Chow Bar. We will also have it at the IU Tailgate Field rather than at the restaurant so the we can socially distance. If you plan to eat, please RSVP so we know how much food to get. You can also just come to the meal if the meditation period doesn't fit in your schedule (but do still RSVP). The Buddhist Study Association has some funds available for the meal if needed, but if you are able to contribute $5-10 it would be much appreciated. We have a Paypal account if you don't have cash.

Finally, just a reminder that we have a meditation period every weekday (Monday through Friday) from 6:30-7:00 p.m. on Zoom at this link: [https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025)

Best wishes,
Doju
