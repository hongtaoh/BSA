Hi all,

Just a quick reminder that the Buddhist Study Association's call out meeting will be tonight at 7:15 pm. We'll explain what kind of activities we will offer this semester and also see if we can come up with some new ideas for this strange semester online. The meeting link is: [https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025).

We will also be having meditation tonight as usual from 6:30 to 7:00 pm. It will take place at the same link above.

Looking forward to seeing you :-)

- Doju
