Hi everyone,

Tomorrow (Friday, September 18th), we will again hold our regular 6:30-7:00 p.m. meditation period outside and in person. We will meet at the **IU Tailgate Field** at the **corner of N Fess Avenue and E 13th Street**. If you put "701 E 13th St Bloomington, IN 47404" into Google Maps it will take you to the area of the field where we are meeting.

The meditation period will be held concurrently on Zoom at the usual link ([https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025)) for those who are not in Bloomington or are not able to attend in person. I will try to bring some cushions to sit on, but if you have your own please bring it.

Afterwards, we will share a vegetarian meal from that is yet to be determined (we're open to suggestions!). If you plan to eat, please RSVP so we know how much food to get. You can also just come to the meal if the meditation period doesn't fit in your schedule (but do still RSVP). The Buddhist Study Association has some funds available for the meal if needed, but if you are able to contribute $5-10 it would be much appreciated. We have a Paypal account if you don't have cash.

Finally, just a reminder that we have a meditation period every weekday (Monday through Friday) from 6:30-7:00 p.m. on Zoom at this link: [https://zoom.us/j/848430025](https://zoom.us/j/848430025)

Best wishes,
Doju
