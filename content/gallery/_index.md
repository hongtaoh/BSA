## March 2019, Early Spring Retreat with Master Jiru

We invided Master Jiru (释继如) from [Mid-America Buddhist Association](http://www.maba-usa.org/) (MABA) to lead a one-day retreat. The retreat was held at a classroom on the third floor of School of Education. Around 20 people attended the retreat. 

The next day, Master Jiru visited [Sanshin Zen Community](http://www.sanshinji.org/) in Bloomington. 

The following photos were taken by Hanwen in both days.

## Yoga

We had a yoga session on top of IMU in late autumn of 2019. The session was led by a Tibeatan monk from [TMBCC](https://www.tmbcc.org/) in Bloomington. 

Photos were taken by Hanwen.
