      <description>Hi everyone,
I hope you&amp;rsquo;re settling into your class schedules by now and managing to stay healthy.

We will meet at the IU Tailgate Field at the corner of N Fess Ave. and E 14th St. If you put &amp;ldquo;IU Tailgate Field&amp;rdquo; into Google Maps you should be able to find directions to it; it is just south of the football stadium.</description>

      <description>Hi all,
Just a quick reminder that the Buddhist Study Association&amp;rsquo;s call out meeting will be tonight at 7:15 pm. We&amp;rsquo;ll explain what kind of activities we will offer this semester and also see if we can come up with some new ideas for this strange semester online. The meeting link is: https://zoom.us/j/848430025.
We will also be having meditation tonight as usual from 6:30 to 7:00 pm. It will take place at the same link above.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Thanks to all of you who dropped in during the virtual involvement fair last week. It was nice meeting you all! Also, if you just signed up to receive e-mails from us in the past few days, we look forward to seeing you soon!
This Friday (September 4th) at 7:15 p.m. (after meditation) we will have a call out meeting for those looking for more information about the group.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
For those of you who showed up to meditation on Monday, I mentioned that we had a different link for meditation on Wednesday. We have simplified and we are now using the same link for the 6:30-7:00 pm meditation every weekday. The link is the same as the one that I sent in the previous e-mail, but it now works for Wednesday evenings too (https://zoom.us/j/848430025).
There is also a book discussion group with people from the Sanshin Zen Community in town that follows the Wednesday evening Zoom meditation (but you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t need to stay for it if you just want to come to meditation).</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Welcome back! I hope everyone and their families have managed to stay safe and healthy. This semester will be a bit bizarre, both generally and for the Buddhist Study Association (BSA) as well, due to the pandemic. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that all of our events will be online, but I will do what I can to explore possibilities to meet in person safely.
For those of you who have never participated with the Buddhist Study Association before, the following should give you a sense of what we have to offer:</description>

      <description>Chapter One It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</description>

      <description>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</description>

      <description>Now pleasing sleep had seal&amp;rsquo;d each mortal eye,
Stretch&amp;rsquo;d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
The immortals slumber&amp;rsquo;d on their thrones above;
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)
To honour Thetis&amp;rsquo; son he bends his care,
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
And thus commands the vision of the night.
&amp;ldquo;Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)</description>
