<p>BSA was established more than a decade ago. Our current leader is Doju, a second-year Master&rsquo;s student at IU studying religion. He has been ordained as a monk according to the Japanese tradition. Our previous leader is Hanwen Fan, who served BSA for two years. He is now a Master&rsquo;s student at Northeastern University. All of the pictures shown on this site were taken by Hanwen. Yifeng, a staff member at the School of Publich Health, has been a regular help for BSA throughout the years.</p>
<p>If you want to join our regulare newsletter, please send your request to Doju at <a href="mailto:djlayton@indiana.edu">djlayton@indiana.edu</a>.</p>
<p>This is what our office looks like:</p>
