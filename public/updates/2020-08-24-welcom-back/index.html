Welcome back! I hope everyone and their families have managed to stay safe and healthy.

<p>Welcome back! I hope everyone and their families have managed to stay safe and healthy. This semester will be a bit bizarre, both generally and for the Buddhist Study Association (BSA) as well, due to the pandemic. It&rsquo;s likely that all of our events will be online, but I will do what I can to explore possibilities to meet in person safely.</p>
<p>For those of you who have never participated with the Buddhist Study Association before, the following should give you a sense of what we have to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A 30 minute meditation period every weekday (currently on Zoom from 6:30-7:00 pm at this link: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/848430025">https://zoom.us/j/848430025</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation instruction if you have never done any kind of meditation (done as needed; just e-mail and we&rsquo;ll set it up!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vegetarian cooking potlucks and workshops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to get involved with Bloomington&rsquo;s local Buddhist communities such as the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center (TMBCC) and the Sanshin Zen Community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoga workshops led by a TMBCC monk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to meet and hang out with people with similar interests</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the last one should probably be emphasized: the BSA is first and foremost is a group of chill people with good vibes that like to hang out and eat delicious food :-)</p>
<p>We will have a &ldquo;table&rdquo; at the Virtual Involvement Fair this Thursday from 4 to 7 pm at this link: <a href="https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119">https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119</a>. If you might be interested but would like to get some more info, please stop by then. You&rsquo;re also welcome to dive right into meditation any weekday evening (including this evening) from 6:30 to 7:00 pm at this link: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/848430025">https://zoom.us/j/848430025</a>. Also feel free to just respond to this email with any questions you might have or if you would like to set up a time for meditation instruction.</p>
<p>Good luck this semester and I hope to see you all soon!</p>
