<meta name="twitter:description" content="Hi everyone,
For those of you who showed up to meditation on Monday, I mentioned that we had a different link for meditation on Wednesday. We have simplified and we are now using the same link for the 6:30-7:00 pm meditation every weekday. The link is the same as the one that I sent in the previous e-mail, but it now works for Wednesday evenings too (https://zoom.us/j/848430025).
There is also a book discussion group with people from the Sanshin Zen Community in town that follows the Wednesday evening Zoom meditation (but you certainly don&rsquo;t need to stay for it if you just want to come to meditation)."/>

<p>For those of you who showed up to meditation on Monday, I mentioned that we had a different link for meditation on Wednesday. We have simplified and we are now using the same link for the 6:30-7:00 pm meditation every weekday. The link is the same as the one that I sent in the previous e-mail, but it now works for Wednesday evenings too (<a href="https://zoom.us/j/848430025">https://zoom.us/j/848430025</a>).</p>
<p>There is also a book discussion group with people from the Sanshin Zen Community in town that follows the Wednesday evening Zoom meditation (but you certainly don&rsquo;t need to stay for it if you just want to come to meditation). Shunryu Suzuki&rsquo;s Zen Mind, Beginner&rsquo;s Mind is the current book being discussed. You do not have to read anything advance if you&rsquo;d like to participate in the book discussion.</p>
<p>Please feel free to join us for meditation any evening of the week (except weekends), and if you&rsquo;re interested in joining but don&rsquo;t have any experience doing meditation yet, just respond to this e-mail and we can arrange a time to do a quick introduction for you.</p>
<p>Also, as a reminder, the BSA will have a virtual table at the online involvement fair tomorrow from 4 to 7 pm. If you want to find out more about the BSA, please drop in anytime during that window. The link for that is <a href="https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119">https://iu.zoom.us/j/92138832119</a>.</p>
<p>Many bows,</p>
<p>Doju</p>
